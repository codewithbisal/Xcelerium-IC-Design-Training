# Restoring Division Algorithm Project with Python Test

## Introduction

This project implements a restoring division algorithm using Verilog, consisting of two main components: the Control Unit and the Data Path. The system divides two 16-bit signed numbers sequentially and outputs a 16-bit signed quotient and a 16-bit signed remainder. The project also includes a testbench for verification using Cocotb.

## What is Cocotb?

Cocotb (Coroutine-based Co-simulation Testbench) is a Python library that allows you to write testbenches for your HDL code (e.g., Verilog, VHDL) in Python. It leverages the simulator's VPI/VHPI interface to provide an efficient way to drive and monitor signals in your design. Cocotb is particularly useful for writing complex testbenches, as it provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with your HDL.

## Prerequisites

- Verilog/SystemVerilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog)
- Python 3.x
- Cocotb library

## Installation

### Cocotb

To install Cocotb, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install cocotb
```

### Icarus Verilog

To install Icarus Verilog, follow these steps:

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```

On macOS (using Homebrew):

```bash
brew install icarus-verilog
```

## Setting Up Cocotb in a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On Unix or macOS:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Cocotb in the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    pip install cocotb
    ```

## Running the Testbench

To run the testbench, use the following command:

```bash
make SIM=icarus
```

This command runs the simulation using Icarus Verilog and executes the Cocotb testbench.

## Viewing Waveforms

To generate waveforms for viewing, ensure your Makefile includes commands to dump VCD files. Once the simulation is complete, you can use GTKWave to view the waveform:

```bash
gtkwave waveform.vcd
```

## Project Structure

### Top Module

The Top Module integrates the Control Unit and Data Path, coordinating the overall division process.

**Inputs:**
- `clk`: Clock signal.
- `reset`: Reset signal to initialize the state.
- `start`: Signal to start the division process.
- `Dividend`, `Divisor`: 32-bit input values for the division.

**Outputs:**
- `Quotient`: 32-bit quotient of the division.
- `Remainder`: 32-bit remainder of the division.
- `ready`: Indicates when the division is complete.

### Control Unit

The Control Unit manages state transitions during the division process, including initialization, iteration, and completion.

**Inputs:**
- `clk`: Clock signal.
- `reset`: Reset signal to initialize the state.
- `start`: Signal to start the division process.
- `count`: Counter value indicating the current step in the division.

**Outputs:**
- `enReg`: Enable signal for loading inputs into registers.
- `mux_sel`: Enable selection for restoring value of Accumulator based on msb of 'Accumulator'.
- `enCount`: Enable signal for the counter and calculation operations.
- `enShift`: Enable signal for shifting during the division process.
- `ready`: Indicates when the division is complete.

### Data Path

The Data Path performs the division operation, computing both the quotient and remainder.

**Inputs:**
- `clk`: Clock signal.
- `reset`: Reset signal to initialize registers.
- `enReg`: Enable signal to load the input values into internal registers.
- `enCount`: Enable signal to increment the count.
- `enShift`: Enable signal to perform shift operations.
- `mux_sel`: Enable selection for restoring value of Accumulator based on msb of 'Accumulator'.
- `Dividend`, `Divisor`: 32-bit input values for the division.

**Outputs:**
- `Quotient`: 32-bit quotient of the division.
- `Remainder`: 32-bit remainder of the division.
- `count`: 5-bit counter value.

## Testbench Explanation

The testbench is written using Cocotb to verify the functionality of the restoring division algorithm. It consists of several key functions and test cases.

### Clock Generation

A clock generation coroutine (`clk_gen`) creates a continuous clock signal for the DUT (Device Under Test).


### Directed Tests

The `directed_tests` coroutine runs specific test cases with known inputs and expected outputs. It initializes the DUT, runs the directed test cases, and logs the pass/fail results.

### Random Tests

The `random_tests` coroutine performs a large number of random test cases to verify the robustness of the division algorithm. It initializes the DUT, runs random test cases, and logs the pass/fail results.

By following this structure, the testbench thoroughly verifies the functionality of the restoring division algorithm, ensuring it handles both directed and random test cases correctly.

## Running the Project

To run the project, a Makefile is provided which can be used by the following commands:

1. **To display the final outputs, run the command below within your virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    make 
    ```

2. **To see waveforms, run the command below:**

    ```bash
    gtkwave dump.vcd
    ```
